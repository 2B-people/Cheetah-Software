/*! @file collision_model.h
 *  @brief Nonlinear friction and collision model used in the simulator for ground contact
 *
 *  The collision model is based on the gcontact.m file in spatial_v2 and modified by Pat for codegen
 *  This uses the model in "Modelling the Contact Between a Rolling Sphere and a Compliant Ground Plane" by
 *  Azad and Featherstone.  It assumes a point contact.
